      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        Emmanuel graduated from University of Cape Coast in 2006 in Ghana with a Bachelors’ degree (First Class Honors) in statistics. He obtained a Master of Science degree in actuarial science in 2009 followed by a PhD in statistics with concentration in actuarial science in 2013, both from University of Calgary (U of C) in Calgary, Canada. His PhD thesis centered on Ultimate Ruin Probability in the Dependent Claim Sizes and Claim Occurrence Times Models. Emmanuel holds membership with numerous professional organizations including the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the United Kingdom, the Actuarial Society of Ghana (ASG), the American Statistical Association, the Statistical Society of Canada, and the Mathematical Association of America. At the ASG, he serves as the education committee member on Analytics. Currently, Emmanuel is a member of the International Actuarial Association Data Analytics Virtual Forum.

      <h3>Research Interests</h3>
      <p>
        My research interest is mainly inspired by applications, especially those from the financial, insurance and health services industries. My research has been on actuarial risk and mortality modeling with their applications. Currently, my research interests are centered on the applications of modern statistical methods and data science techniques to high-dimensional messy and massive data sets.
